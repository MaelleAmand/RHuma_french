# RHuma_french

Ces TP sont faits pour les étudiants en sciences humaines. De nouveaux TPs seront progressivement ajoutés.
*Lab sessions for students of humanities (in French). Lab sessions will be modified and added progressively.*

To Build these lab sessions I drew inspiration from Taylor Arnold's lab sessions given at Paris Diderot, Aurélie Fischer's Data Analysis lab sessions and Clément Levrard's course in statistics for linguists at Paris Diderot.

Thanks to teachers from Maths departments who cross the boarder towards the humanities to make us discover their world. 
Thank you for all those who worked hard to create MOOCS on data analysis, those who answered questions in forums on RStudio and the Youtubers who make us progress.
